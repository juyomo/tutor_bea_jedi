# Homework from Aug 3

## 1. `NOT / AND / OR`

Evaluate the following expressions. Will they be True or False?

**Note: DO NOT run them in Python first! Try to evaluate the expressions by hand first.**

(a)

```py

x = 3
x > 3 # expression to evaluate
```

(b)

```py

(not (3 > 2) and (5 + 2 == 7)) # expression to evaluate
```

(c) This question has multiple expressions to evaluate.

```py

p = True
q = False

# Evaluate all three of the following expressions:
p or (not q)
(p and q) and (not p)
(p and q) or (p and not q) or (not p and not q)
```

(d) This question has multiple expressions to evaluate.

```py

# Evaluate both of the following:
12 % 3 == 0
5 % 3 == 1
```

## 2. Testing & edge cases

What would be good edge cases for testing our program in the file [0803_grades.py](/0803_grades.py)?

Come up with a list of values of `grade`s to test and try running it as we did in class!

## 3. Invalid grade

Add code to [0803_grades.py](/0803_grades.py) to output "invalid grade" if the grade is too high (e.g. 101) or too low (e.g. -1).

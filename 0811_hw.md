## String Operations - reading code

Do not run the code in this section but rather, think about what the result would be and write them down either on paper or in a text file.

(1) What will be the result of the following code?

```py
x = 'Welcome'
print(x[3])
```

(2) What will be the result of the following code?

```py
x = 'Welcome'
print(x[3:])
```

(3) What will be the result of the following code?

```py
s = "GfG"

print(s[1])
s1 = s + s[0]
print(s1)
```

(4) What will be the result of the following code?

```py
s = "oranges"
print(len(s))
```

(5) What will be the result of the following code?

```py
s = "Hello World"
print(s.upper())
print(s.lower())
```

(6) What will be the result of the following code?

```py
s = "Hello "
print(s * 3)
```

## String Operations - writing code

Create a Python file and perform the following exercises in the file.

(1) Concatenate the following strings and print the result

```py
# Join the two strings into "Hello World"
str1 = "Hello"
str2 = "World"
```

(2) Print the first character of the string using indexing

```py
word = "Python"
```

(3) Extract the substring "hon" from the string

```py
word = "Python"
```

(4) Convert the following string to lowercase

```py
text = "HELLO THERE"
```

(5) Turn "red,green,blue" into "red green blue"

```py
colors = "red,green,blue"
```

(6) Find the length of the following string

```py
str = "Roses are green, violets are blue..."
```

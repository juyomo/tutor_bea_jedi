# 7/27 (Sunday)

We continued to learn about if, else if, and else, using examples of numbers being divisible by 2 and/or 3.

```py

# Assign a value to the variable x

x = 4

# Print different statements depending on whether x is divisible by 2, 3, or both.

if (x % 6 == 0):
    print("Divisible by 6")
elif (x % 2 == 0):
    print("Divisible by 2 only") 
elif (x % 3 == 0):
    print("Divisible by 3 only")
else:
    print("Not divisible by 2 or 3")
```

## HW
1. Write a program that assigns an integer to a variable, and prints the following according to the following rules:
* If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e. if it is divisible by 15), print "FizzBuzz"
* If the number is only divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
* If the number is only divisible by 5, print "Buzz"
* Otherwise, print the number itself
